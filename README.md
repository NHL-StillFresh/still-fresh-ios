#### 4.2 Set up the connection in Still Fresh?
- To set up the Supabase connection head over to ``SupaClient.swift``
- Replace our credentials with your in ``supabaseKey`` and ``supabaseURL`` (Hint: don't want to set up a database? feel free to use our credentials)
- Now the app is ready to be built and/or debugged

### 5. Set up openrouter
